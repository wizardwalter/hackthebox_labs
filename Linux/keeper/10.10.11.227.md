2 ports open

lets check site...
![[Pasted image 20250922205408.png]]

lets add tickets.keep.htb to etc/hosts

this is running request tracker... i looked it up and found default creds:
`root:password`

i try to ssh in but nothing...
so:
now that i am in under the admin tab we can find another user:
![[Pasted image 20250922211137.png]]
`lnorgaard`

i just clicked go and got this err:
![[Pasted image 20250922211235.png]]
 could be our way in but lets keep digging...

if i click on the users name i find a comments field with this:
```
New user. Initial password set to Welcome2023!
```

cool!

lets try ssh in with these creds...

```
ssh lnorgaard@10.10.11.227
```

password `Welcome2023!`

```
lnorgaard@keeper:~$ cat user.txt
